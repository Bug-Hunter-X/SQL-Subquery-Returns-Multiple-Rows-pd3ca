The SQL query uses a subquery that returns more than one row, where only one row is expected. This can lead to unexpected results or errors, depending on the database system used. For example, the following query attempts to update a column with the value from a subquery that may return multiple rows:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = (SELECT avg(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales')
WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

This query will fail in many database systems, as it tries to assign multiple average salaries to the Marketing department. It should be rewritten to handle cases where the subquery might return multiple rows, such as by using aggregation functions or joining tables appropriately.
