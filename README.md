This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon SQL error: a subquery returning more than one row when only one is expected. The `bug.sql` file shows the problematic query, and `bugSolution.sql` demonstrates the corrected version.  This error can be tricky to debug as it may not always result in a clear error message.  The issue arises when a subquery designed to provide a single value for an update or other operation instead returns multiple rows. The database system often doesn't know which value to choose, resulting in either an error or incorrect data manipulation. The solution typically involves modifying the subquery to guarantee a single-row result or refactoring the query to handle multiple rows appropriately.
