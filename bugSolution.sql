To correct this, the subquery needs to be rewritten to ensure that it returns only a single row.  Several approaches can be used, depending on the desired outcome.  Here's one solution:

If you intend to update the `salary` of each `Marketing` employee with the average `salary` of all employees in the `Sales` department, you should handle this differently:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = (SELECT avg(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales')
WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

This approach is correct if the intent is to update all employees in the 'Marketing' department to have the same salary.  This is different from the initial flawed approach where only one value could be assigned.  The original issue stemmed from the database unable to choose a single row, which is avoided by updating all rows to the same value. If you need different updates, then additional logic might be needed (e.g. join operations).  Always ensure your subqueries produce the expected number of rows to avoid this type of error.
